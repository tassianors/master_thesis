A new interpretation of term clusters and cluster coefficients of polynomial models is provided based on this approach. The paper discusses model limitations and some useful principles to select the structure of nonlinear maps. Some of the ideas have been tested using several nonlinear systems including a boost voltage regulator map and a set of real data from a chaotic circuit.}

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

The approach is thus not model-based. The scheme converges to a stationary point of the design criterion under the assumption of boundedness of the signals in the loop. From a practical viewpoint, the scheme offers several advantages. It is straightforward to apply. It is possible to control the rate of change of the controller in each iteration. The objective can be manipulated between iterations in order to tighten or loosen performance requirements. Certain frequency regions can be emphasized if desired. This direct optimal tuning algorithm is particularly well suited for the tuning of the basic control loops in the process industry, which are typically PID loops. These primary loops are often very badly tuned, making the application of more advanced (for example, multivariable) techniques rather useless. A first requirement in the successful application of advanced control techniques is that the primary loops be tuned properly. This new technique appears to be a very practical way of doing this, with an almost automatic procedure},

The method was originally developed for linear time-invariant systems, but many successful applications to nonlinear system have been reported in the literature. The contribution of this paper is to provide a preliminary analysis of IFT for nonlinear systems. This analysis sheds some light on the question of which nonlinear systems IFT may be expected to work for and also gives some guidance on how to choose the user's design variables for nonlinear problems. The discussions are backed up by simulations as well as an application to a DC-servo with backlash which initially exhibits a limit cycle},

The paper is divided into two parts. The first part introduces and defines concepts such as Nerode realization, multistructural forms and results from differential geometry which are then used to derive a recursive input-output model for multivariable deterministic non-linear systems. The second part introduces several examples, compares the derived model with other representations and extends the results to create prediction error or innovation input-output models for non-linear stochastic systems. These latter models are the generalization of the multivariable ARM AX models for linear systems and are referred to as NARMAX or Non-linear AutoRegressive Moving Average models with exogenous inputs. }

It is shown that the minimization of this criterion does not require a model of the system. Closed loop experimental data can be used instead. The result is an iterative scheme of closed loop experiments and controller updates which converges to a local minimum of the design criterion under the condition of bounded signals},

A convergence analysis is presented using the differential equation approach, and the new concept of m-invertibility is introduced. The analysis shows that while a highly non-linear process model may be used to capture the non-linearity of the system it is advisable to fit a simple noise model. The results of applying the algorithm to both simulated and real data are included. }
